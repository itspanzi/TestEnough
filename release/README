Description
===========

TestEnough is a library that helps you run a very small subset of tests based on changes to production code.

First, you need to run TestEnough once so that the information about which method is tested by what tests is captured. Once this information is available,
TestEnough can run only those tests which test the methods that were changed.

How does it work?
=================

TestEnough does a Byte Code Instrumentation of the classes that are loaded and adds a piece of code to every method definition. This code gets called
whenever a method is called. This is the tracker code that figures out the test that is running currently.
